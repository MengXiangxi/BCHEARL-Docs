About the project \u00b6 Harmonization of PET quantification performance is not only important in multicenter clinical trials, but also affects the accuracy in clinical diagnosis. Currently, many influential protocols for PET harmonization involve imaging the NEMA/IEC IQ phantom and obtaining the recovery coefficient (RC) curves, including the EARL protocol. However, there are only a handful of tools to obtain the RCs from the PET images of the phantoms. The community still needs yet another tool to build their pipelines. In light of this, I developed a personal pipeline, emulating the EARL protocol, to perform harmonization evaluations. I have already applied this protocol in multiple healthcare providers in Beijing. I hope you enjoy the project and the tool.
